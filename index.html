		<h2> Behind the screen </h2>
		<p>Hi! I’m Sonal, a designer and a front end web developer from Ottawa, Canada.</p>
		
		<p>I started out as a little forum crawler in the early 2000’s, learning basic Photoshop skills to make pretty graphics for my gaming signatures. I abused those free DeviantArt brushes, a lot. I realized that I could further my skills when other gamers started asking me to make their tags, and soon after I learned to take my passion for creativity and channel it into creating clean and aesthetically pleasing designs that were functional. Not only did I increase my level of expertise in Photoshop, I also learned to use the entire Creative Suite, create beautiful websites with HTML &amp; CSS, and even dabbled in 2d animation (which fascinates me to no end).</p>

		<p>When i’m not fussing over my design work, you can usually find me relaxing with tea and comfy blankets, playing hacked split screen games on a projector with a killer sound system.</p>
